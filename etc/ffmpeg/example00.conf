# Definition of the live feeds. Each live feed contains one video

# ffserver. This sequence may be encoded simultaneously with several
# codecs at several resolutions.

<Feed feed.ffm>

# You must use 'ffmpeg' to send a live feed to ffserver. In this
# example, you can type:
#

File /tmp/feed.ffm
FileMaxSize 100M

# You could specify
# ReadOnlyFile /saved/specialvideo.ffm
# This marks the file as readonly and it will not be deleted or updated.

# Only allow connections from localhost to the feed.
